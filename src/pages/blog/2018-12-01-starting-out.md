About a year ago, my friend and I lamented how infrequently we read these days, so we lent each other a book. She handed me “Eating Animals”, by Jonathan Safron Foer, and quietly to myself, I groaned.

My feeling was reading this book would be akin to taking the red pill — there would be no unlearning who knows what horrific things lay ahead in the world of abattoirs and factory farming.

At the time, I would not have classified myself a meat obsessive (though looking back, I can rattle off a long list of meat I love to eat —- and when.) I liked my bacon sandwiches when camping in the morning, my occasional steaks, my NYC hot dogs, my Thanksgiving turkeys...

But, I’d always meant to get around to reading Foer, so I gave it a shot.

What ensued is a journey that I hope to chronicle here, on how I attempt to live a life that is kinder to the planet: with less plastic, less meat, fewer pollutants.
