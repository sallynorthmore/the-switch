About a year ago, I lamented to a friend how infrequently I read these days, so she lent me a book. She handed me “Eating Animals”, by Jonathan Safron Foer, and quietly to myself, I groaned. Was this another vegetarian conversion tool?

My real fear of reading the book was akin to choosing between the red and blue pills; there would be no unlearning who knows what horrific things lay ahead in the world of abattoirs and factory farming.

At the time, I would not have classified myself a meat obsessive (though looking back, I can rattle off a long list of meat I love to eat —- and when.) I liked my bacon sandwiches when camping in the morning, my occasional steaks, my NYC hot dogs, my Thanksgiving turkeys...

But, I’d always meant to get around to reading Foer, so I gave it a shot.

What ensued surprised me: a journey that I hope to chronicle here on how I attempt to live a life that is kinder to the planet.

Less plastic, less meat, fewer pollutants.
