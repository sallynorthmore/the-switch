Day 19: We're running out of laundry liquid so I'm going to experiment with #soapnuts. They're meant to be #ecofriendly, so you're not constantly pumping Ariel into your waste water ☣️. At 100 washes for £5.99, that's 3 times what we get out of a tub of Ariel.

According to @ecozone it comes to 3p per wash. Plus, it's biodegradable rubbish, instead a big empty plastic tub.

They did the job, but weirdly, I have become so conditioned to the smell of clean laundry == laundry liquid perfums, I'm struggling to use the soap nuts. They clean, but my clothes just smell like wet clothes, and that doesn't feel clean.
