Day 1: Happy 2019! It's the first day of my January #notosingleuseplastic challenge and I'm feeling a little anxious.

I googled Single Use Plastics (SUPs) and I kid you not, the first site that pops up is a letter from the plastics industry claiming avoiding plastic will only lead to more environmental pollution 🤦👎🖕🐽. Man, they really have no shame.

We're at my parent's place and luckily fairly stocked up for the moment, so, today my plan is to identify all of my daily SUP consumption and find alternatives. It sadly affects most of my favourite (and healthy) foods. 😔

Only half of these kitchen items are technically single-use, even if they're all packaged in plastic, so that's some relief.

Planning ahead is important: to break this addiction, it's going to require alternatives to hand and not giving in at the first hurdle.

Staten Island isn't exactly overcrowded with fresh organic produce markets, so my diet might be a little limited until I get back to London.
