Day 16: I've run out of food containers so I'm trying out the reusable, washable beeswax wraps by @abeego 🐝 instead of dat nasty plastic cling film (buuhhhhbye!)

They work great. Washing them with cold water means I can reuse them again and again.

I've even found storing cheese and herbs in the wraps prolong their shelflife.
