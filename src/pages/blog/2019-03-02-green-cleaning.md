This is roughly all you need to clean most things in your house:

![](/img/cleaning.jpg)

Baking soda

White/clear vinegar

Hydrogen peroxide (whitening)

Rubbing alcohol (streak-free glass)

Vodka (air freshener)

Essential oils to suit your taste or for their antibacterial properties, like tea tree and peppermint

It's cheap, and it's easy on your pets and little ones.

I'm mixing up a glass polish right now and experimenting with woodsy oils like cedar and pine because I love the smell of the woods... It requires a light touch so I'm obviously terrible at it!
