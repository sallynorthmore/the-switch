♻️ Perennial bulbs like #daffodils #tulips #astrantia #echinops and #allium are my favourite and you only buy and plant once for years of returns in flowers 🌿 They multiply over the years as well, so you can dig them up, split them, and replant all over your garden or window boxes. Or gift them to special friends 👌😀
