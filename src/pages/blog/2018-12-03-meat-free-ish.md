It's really easy to despair when you take in the massive amounts of waste we've already dumped onto the Earth (and continue to at a dizzying rate.) But there **are** actions we can personally take, and in numbers would really make an impact.

According to [scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth):

"Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth"

One of the first things I challenged myself to do off the back of reading Foer was to cut meat out from my diet.

In all honesty, I've severely reduced (hashtag) my meat consumption but I can't yet call myself a bonafide vegetarian.

This means I've stopped buying meat from our weekly Tesco shop, and committed to cutting beef out of my diet completely.

I even recently switched from cow milk to a plant-based drink, Oatly. I wasn't convinced at first, and found it a touch watery and unsatisfying in my dangerously dark coffees.

But then I discovered their "Whole" variety and **YUMMAYYYYMUMMMAY**! It is **so** creamy and delicious, it's way better than the semi-skim cowjuice I was so used to... not to mention, much better for the planet.
