Before I really had any idea how to tackle this whole plastic-free mission, I knew the bathroom would be one of the easier places to start. (The kitchen is still daunting and where most of the crimes take place.)

I did a brief little search online for shampoo and conditioner bars, and Lush cosmetics seemed the most readily available to me (ie: I could pop in and pick some up on my lunch hour.)

I'm a little precious about what I use on my hair, so I knew it would take a few attempts. I'm yet to discover a moisturising, detangling conditioner bar.

So I started with [Jason & The Argan Oil](https://uk.lush.com/products/shampoo/jason-and-argan-oil):

A purple bar resembling a French macaron that lathers up nicely with a little water, is moisturizing, and leaves my hair smelling lightly tastey. I find Lush a bit over-perfumed, but this bar smells more subdued. It cost me roughly Â£7 (same as my plastic-alternative) and lasted me about 2 months! Not bad.

For conditioner, I've paired it with [Jungle](https://uk.lush.com/products/conditioners/jungle). It smells gorgeous, like I've been showering outdoors in the wilds of Canada. Unfortunately, it's not exactly the detangler my medium-length hair requires, so I've alternated with my plastic bottled (eurgh) staple until I find the right bar.

**Overall review? Great and easy switch.**

Bars so far are cheaper than the bottle version, plastic free, look and smell great, and generally are more visually pleasing than the naff-branded plastic alternatives.

You'll want to pick up a cheap little tray to pop your bars on so they dry quickly between washes. Putting them in cups just ends up melting them in shower water (yes, this is personal experience.)
