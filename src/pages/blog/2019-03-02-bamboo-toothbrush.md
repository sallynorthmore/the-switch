Day 11: I don't think we should go around blowing our money on wood and glass products unnecessarily just to feel like we're #livingclean ðŸ˜‡, but I genuinely left my plastic toothbrush back in NYC and the only reasonable replacement is a bamboo toothbrush.

This one is from @ethicalsuperstore and cost me Â£3.99. it comes in various softnesses. It took 2 days to deliver and only came in recyclable paper. ðŸ¤˜
