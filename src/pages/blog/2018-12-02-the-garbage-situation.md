It's shocking how much rubbish our household shizzes on a weekly basis.

![](/img/post-2.jpg)

As you can see, we have a rubbish bin, a recycling bin, and a small compost bin.

About 3 80-litre bags of rubbish go the front door per week. (24 litres of trash)

A 100-litre recycling bin gets filled about 1.5 times per week (~150 litres of plastic, tin, glass and paper)

The compost I'd like to think is negligible...

How on earth do the two of us manage to tip so much shiz out onto the earth on a weekly basis?
