Some #zerowaste travel tips, and it all goes in your carry-on luggage.

![](/img/travel.png)

Shampoo and conditioner bars mean no travel-size plastic, or worrying about packing heavy, leaking bottles. I just bring what I usually use, in little tin cases. These are from @lush

@loccitane gift sets often include reusable, and durable containers, which I use for face oil and creams. Some of their shops will sell these sizes to you, others include them as free gifts with a purchase. I just decant my larger pots into these little guys before we leave town. They've lasted years.
