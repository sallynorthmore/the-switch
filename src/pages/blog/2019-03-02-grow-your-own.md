Spinach and rocket salad without the plastic! I eat spinach almost daily, but it's one of the few vegetables I now struggle to find not wrapped in plastic at the shop (even the green grocer), so I am experimenting growing my own. 🌱

The weather is unseasonably balmy so... good so far, but when the temperature dips again, I'll put the cloches on top to protect the seedlings you can see growing. 🌿

By sowing a new crop every few weeks, I'm hoping to have continual crops until next autumn 🙏🤞
