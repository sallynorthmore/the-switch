This plastic-free bottle is a real game changer. I've lost it three times now, so fingers crossed this one lasts. Isn't that testament to how much I like it?

I bypassed the overpriced, single-use plastic bottled drinks at the airport and headed straight to the free, chilled, water fountain.

I think 700ml is the sweet spot in terms of volume. It's just enough to keep me drinking lots of water without being too heavy and bulky to carry around with me.

Roughly £15. 🎁🤘🌎💚
